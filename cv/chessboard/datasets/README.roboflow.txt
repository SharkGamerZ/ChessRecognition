The dataset includes 609 images.
Chess are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random rotation of between -45 and +45 degrees
* Random shear of between -17째 to +17째 horizontally and -18째 to +18째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.7 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.76 percent of pixels
